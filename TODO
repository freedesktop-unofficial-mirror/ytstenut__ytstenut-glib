TODO

* ytsg_client_connect_to_mesh() -> ytsg_client_connect()
* Need to pass jid, or better sending service, with received message.
* Roster should be created with _new() instead of _get() from client.
* Should send-file really be with YtsgContact? Why not Service? Which service is receiving the file?
* Get rid of --enable-docs and adhere to --enable-gtk-doc only.
* Add checking and error reporting when service name doesn't conform when creating YtsgClient.
