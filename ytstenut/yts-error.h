/**
 * YtsError:
 * @YTS_ERROR_SUCCESS: Operation succeeded,
 * @YTS_ERROR_PENDING: The operation will be completed at a later stage,
 * subject to completing intermediate asynchronous operations (implies success
 * up to the point the asynchronous operation began). The operation to which
 * it pertains can be retrieved from the #YtsError value using
 * yts_error_get_atom().  Operations that return this error code must emit
 * #YtsClient::error signal at a later stage to indicate either subsequent
 * errors or eventual success.
 * @YTS_ERROR_OBJECT_DISPOSED: the object is in process of being destroyed
 * @YTS_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER: Invalid parameter supplied to function
 * @YTS_ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED: the operation is not allowed.
 * @YTS_ERROR_NO_ROUTE: no route to complete the operation
 * @YTS_ERROR_UNKNOWN: some other,unspecified, error condition.
 * @YTS_ERROR_CUSTOM_START: custom error codes can start at this value
 * @YTS_ERROR_CUSTOM_END: custom error code must not exceed this value
 *
 * YtsError represents common errors for nScreen operation; YtsError combines
 * an error code defined by the above enumeration and an atom value that
 * uniquely identifies the operation associated with the value. Use
 * yts_error_get_code() and yts_error_get_atom() to retrieve these components.
